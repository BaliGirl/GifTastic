# GifTastic
<ul>This project uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice.</ul>

<ul>The requirement, I must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.</ul>

<ul>The topics I chose is about "type of sports" such as Basketball, Tennis, etc.</ul>

<ul>I also added a form to my page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it into my`topics` (sport) array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.</ul>

<ul><b>This project turns to be something pretty cool!</b></ul>
